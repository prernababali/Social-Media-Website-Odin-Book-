# 📱 OdinBook — A Full-Stack Social Media Platform

**OdinBook** is a responsive, modern full-stack social media web application developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It replicates core functionalities of platforms like Facebook and Twitter — enabling user interaction through posts, comments, likes, and social followings, all within a secure, session-based authentication system.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

> OdinBook showcases how full-stack concepts work in harmony — from database modeling and user authentication to frontend templating and stateful user sessions.

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- Local authentication via **Passport.js** using username & password
- Middleware (`ensureAuth`) to protect all internal routes
- **Session management** using `express-session` and persistent PostgreSQL-based storage

### 👥 User Social System
- Browse all registered users
- Send and manage **follow requests** (pending or accepted)
- View other users’ profile pages with their posts and statistics

### 📝 Post Feed
- Create and manage text-based posts
- See your posts and those from users you follow
- Post cards display author info, likes, and comments

### ❤️ Like & Comment System
- Like/unlike any post with immediate feedback
- Comment with author & timestamp shown
- Clean UI experience with real-time visibility

### 🧾 Personalized Dashboard
- Displays posts only from followed users + your own
- Sorted in reverse chronological order (latest first)
- Clean Bootstrap cards with structured content

### 👤 User Profile Page
- View profile details, follower/following count
- Upload and update **profile pictures via Cloudinary**
- Only logged-in users can view/edit profiles
